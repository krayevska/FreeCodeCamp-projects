**Responsive Web Design Projects** - [**Build a Tribute Page**](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page)<br><br>
**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.<br>
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass.<br> 
Give it your own personal style.<br>
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project.<br> 
Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far<br> 
and you should get some practice with plain CSS. 
You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose.<br>
Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project,<br>
and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React.<br>
We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!<br><br>
**User Story #1:** My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.<br>
**User Story #2:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes<br> 
the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").<br>
**User Story #3:** I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".<br>
**User Story #4:** Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".<br>
**User Story #5:** Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption"<br>
that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.<br>
**User Story #6:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", <br>
which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.<br>
**User Story #7:** I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link",<br>
which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.<br>
**User Story #8:** The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element,<br>
