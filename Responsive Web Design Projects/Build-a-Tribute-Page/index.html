   The show's name came from its setting, a small fictional Washington town. Exteriors were primarily filmed in Snoqualmie and North Bend, Washington; most of the interior scenes were shot on standing sets in a San Fernando Valley warehouse (excluding the pilot, which was both filmed in Washington state).

   Twin Peaks became one of 1990's top-rated shows, a critical success both nationally and internationally. Reflecting its devoted cult fan base, the series became a part of popular culture, referenced in other television shows, commercials, comic books, video games, films and song lyrics.
