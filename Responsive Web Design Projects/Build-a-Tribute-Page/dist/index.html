  Twin Peaks is an American television serial drama created by David Lynch and Mark Frost. The series follows the investigation, headed by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), of the brutal murder of a popular teenager and homecoming queen, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). The pilot was first broadcast on April 8, 1990, on the ABC Network, which led to another seven episodes being produced, and a second season, which aired until June 10, 1991.

  The show's name came from its setting, a small fictional Washington town. Exteriors were primarily filmed in Snoqualmie and North Bend, Washington; most of the interior scenes were shot on standing sets in a San Fernando Valley warehouse (excluding the pilot, which was both filmed in Washington state).

   Twin Peaks became one of 1990's top-rated shows, a critical success both nationally and internationally. Reflecting its devoted cult fan base, the series became a part of popular culture, referenced in other television shows, commercials, comic books, video games, films and song lyrics.
