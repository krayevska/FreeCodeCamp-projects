Responsive Web Design Projects - [Build a Survey Form](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/)
<br>
**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP.<br>
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.<br>
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project.<br>
Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far <br>
and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose.<br>
Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) <br>
are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. <br>
Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. <br>
We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project.<br>
Happy coding!
